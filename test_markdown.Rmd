## Looking back to spring 2021

In the beginning of 2021 GameStop was an almost bankrupt company. Then something strange happend on the subreddit r/wallstreetbets. This subredit known for the "risk seeking" gamblers collectively decided to pump up the GameStop price zo 420,69$. In addition to a potential big gain for the gamblers and a funny meme the redditors also wanted to challenge Wallstreet which had a large amount of short positions on GameStop.

```{r picture of GameStop Stock, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = read.csv(file = "GME_2021.csv")) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x=as.Date(Date), y =Close)) + labs(x= "Date" , y = "Closing of GME", title = "Stock price of GameStop in 2021")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("datum~sentiment.jpeg")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
